## Windows Antivirus
As you may notice, when launching the Empanadas.io installer, Windows will mark the program as dangerous. This is because Windows want to charge a $200 "code signing" fee yearly to "protect it's users". In reality, all you're paying for is what Windows should allow apps to do: run. To bypass this, click "more info" on the prompt then click "run anyways". We promise our app is filled with nothing but Empanadas.

## Open-Source Transparency
Some files from this open source project (as seen in the .gitignore file) are not visible. These files are massive and only are used by Electron to store its dependencies. Electron itself is already open source, so reuploading it's contents wouldn't make sense.
